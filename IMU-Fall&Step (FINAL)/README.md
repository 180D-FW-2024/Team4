## mainimu.py â€“ Fall Detection & Step Counter

The `mainimu.py` script is the source code and is the Nightwatcher's fall detection and step counter algorithms combined into one runnable code.

This folder contains the libraries and scripts (from Ozzmaker's BerryIMU repository) to read the angles from the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer on a BerryIMU connected to a Raspberry Pi.

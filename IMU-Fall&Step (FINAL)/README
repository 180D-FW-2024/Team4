This folder contains the libraries and scripts (from Ozzmaker's BerryIMU repository) to read the angles from the acceleromter, gyrscope
and mangnetometer on a BerryIMU connected to a Raspberry Pi.

The mainimu.py script is the Nightwatcher's fall detection and step counter algorithms combined into one runnable code.

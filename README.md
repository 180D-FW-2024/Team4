# Team 4: NightWatcher (Sleepwalker Detection System)

## Project Overview
This is a **Sleepwalker Detection Project**, designed as a monitoring **Internet of Things (IoT) System**. The system consists of multiple components working together to ensure real-time detection and response. Currently, there are **three agents** with various codes that must be executed for the **Nightwatcher** system to function effectively.

# Installation and Setup

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your computer, our development was catered to be mainly used on the Raspberry Pi 4.

---

## Necessary folders for installation 
### 1) RPI Main Server
Access the subfolder RPI_Main_Sever

### 2) IMU and Stepcounter
Access the subfolder IMU-Fall&Step (FINAL) 

### 3) Speech Processor 
Access the subfolder Speech Processor (FINAL) 

### 4) Autonmous Rover
Access the subfolder Rover(FINAL) 


## Where to find instructions for each Unit (Total of 4 subfolders) 

Within each folder IMU-Fall&Step (FINAL), Speech Processor (FINAL), Rover (FINAL), RPi_Main_Server, will each individually have their own README.md file that displays instruction on how to set up each subunit.


## User Manual for full instructions 
For full description and instruction on how to utilize Nightwatcher, Here is the user manual provided.


## Order on how to run each unit in the NightWatcher system
It is advisable that the Speech Processor, IMU, and Rover setup scripts to be run first and activating the Main Server last. As this would ensure reproduceabiltiy and accuracy of desired results for this to be an effective IoT system for Sleepwalking Monitoring.
